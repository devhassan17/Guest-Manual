    <h3>Joyce</h3>
    <p>Empires Property Cleaning did an amazing job cleaning my house. The team was punctual, friendly, and very thorough — they paid attention to every detail, from the kitchen surfaces to the skirting boards. My home looked spotless. They worked efficiently without cutting corners, and I really appreciated their professionalism. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for reliable and high‑quality cleaning services.</p>

    <h3>Baard</h3>
    <p>I sent a Bark request so that my 2‑bedroom North London flat could be cleaned following a 4‑month refurbishment project, thereby making it possible to move in. The request was made late in the afternoon on a Saturday, and Shamaine from Empires Property answered within minutes. Once the scope of work was clear, she also offered to be there on site with a team of two cleaners at 9am the following morning.</p>
    <p>This responsiveness made all the difference for the moving‑in process, both logistically and by creating that sense of comfort and homeliness.</p>
    <p>Shamaine is a very good communicator, has high standards and knows how to set expectations, working well with her team as well as the customer. She also made sure that the situation “before” and “after” (easily described as a transformation — I was super‑chuffed) was well documented and shared with me as the customer.</p>
    <p>This was also reassuringly backed up by Shamaine attending the site before, during and after the cleaning job, making sure everything was done well.</p>
    <p>All in all, I would highly recommend the cleaning services provided by Empires Property. This was a very positive customer experience from start to finish — simply top notch!</p>

    <p>Excellent service. I needed a last‑minute domestic clean for my flat and Shamaine managed to book me in with Alma. Alma was very attentive and did an excellent job. Would definitely recommend their service to others.</p>
